          <h2>Adventures In Dvorakland</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Ah... Dvorak. That strange, mystical keyboard layout for super nerds. Let&#39;s take
years of muscle memory and take a huge dump on it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dvorakland.jpg" alt="Carwin&#39;s Dvorakland"></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">History</h2>

<p>The Dvorak keyboard layout was invented by August Dvorak in the late 1930s to
replace the QWERTY layout which he had deemed inefficient after studying English
letter frequencies and hand physiology (thanks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>I came across Dvorak while searching for ways to improve my efficiency during my
day to day work activities. While researching some time-management techniques, I
came across a forum post where a few folks were discussing the layout and touting
an increase in overall typing speed.</p>

<p>Saliva immediately began fountaining from my mouth. I cried tears of joy. A parade
was held in my hometown to congratulate me on such a wonderful discovery.</p>

<p>Well, not really -- but I still can&#39;t think of a better way to improve
my efficiency than to just <em>type faster</em>. That&#39;s the computer nerd&#39;s dream right?
Sure, you need to worry about accuracy when typing and time management,
but a big part of what I do is all about typing things I&#39;ve typed a million times
before. Typing faster would be an enormous benefit, hell, I&#39;d probably punch a
crate full of &lt; insert adorable animal &gt;s if it meant I could type 300wpm.</p>

<p>So, filled with fanciful dreams of insane typing powers - I decided I would commit
to learning the Dvorak layout. After all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Blackburn">the holder of the world record
for typing speed used Dvorak</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Round 1, Fight</h2>

<p>I started my switch one Friday evening after work. Using two tiny little screwdrivers,
I popped the keys off of my MacBook Air and re-arranged them in this terrifying
new order. It looked pretty cool but was also insanely daunting.</p>

<p>To get situated, I used <a href="http://type-fu.com">TypeFu</a> to train. The statistics
feature is pretty great, and I also really like the layout and functionality compared
to other typing tutors I&#39;ve used in the past (Mavis Beacon anyone?).</p>

<p>After an entire weekend spent with Dvorak I was up to about 30wpm, down from my
top score of 113wpm (average speed 80s-90s) using QWERTY.</p>

<p>Monday was not a good work day. I immediately became frustrated while coding, and
finally had to give up and switch back to QWERTY during lunch because I was completely
unable to communicate over IRC in a timely manner.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Round 2, Making It Stick</h2>

<p>Nearly a month later I decided to give the switch another try, but this time, I used
some sense and decided to only use Dvorak on the weekends -- which goes against
what everything I&#39;ve read on the subject of switching teaches.</p>

<p>After somewhere in the neighborhood of two months, I was up to a consistent
45wpm with Dvorak and decided to commit fully. This time it took pretty well.
I was able to communicate with text, albeit somewhat more slowly and my typing
speed got better and better every day.</p>

<p>This was the real turning point for my switch, I needed to be able to type well
enough to be able to do my job - even if it meant needing to put in a few extra
hours off the clock to compensate for my slowness. The sheer need of getting
back up to speed forced me to get better, although that might be my imagination.</p>

<p>I did however start to notice a lot of things that made life really tough:</p>

<ul>
<li>Login screens in OSX default to QWERTY</li>
<li>Every muscle memory I had developed for Vim was destroyed</li>
<li>Shortcuts for everything are now in different places</li>
<li>Playing any sort of game involving WASD movement means tinkering with layouts</li>
<li> My wife can no longer use my computer for anything</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I&#39;ve since overcome a lot of these issues, which I&#39;ll go over in Pt. 2</em></p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Dvorak, my BFF</h2>

<p>I&#39;m still using Dvorak today, it&#39;s been two and a half months since I committed
to the layout a second time.</p>

<p>My typing speed averages in the 60-70wpm range, I&#39;ve made a lot of keyboard customizations
and I&#39;m back to feeling comfortable in Vim. I&#39;m fairly skeptical of the purported
typing speed increases that users gain with a Dvorak layout, but I think there
are plenty of other reasons to keep using it.</p>

<p>Mainly, it just feels more comfortable to type on for long periods of time.
I&#39;ve been told this is due to the alternating nature of keystrokes that Dvorak
encourages, roughly every other letter is (theoretically) typed with a different hand.
Seems pretty ergonomic to me.</p>

<p>If you plan on trying the switch to Dvorak, my best advice is to just keep at it.
It takes time, and I can&#39;t promise it&#39;ll be worth it, but so far I really like it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a follow up post to this one in the works with resources for Dvorak users,
but if you can&#39;t wait feel free to ping me on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/carwin">@carwin</a>.</p>

<p>Also, Wikipedia has this neat list of famous Dvorak users which I find to be pretty
damn cool:</p>

<ul>
<li>Barbara Blackburn, world typing speed record holder</li>
<li>Bram Cohen, inventor of BitTorrent</li>
<li>Terry Goodkind, author of The Sword of Truth</li>
<li>Holly Lisle, American author</li>
<li>Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress</li>
<li>Nathan Myhrvold, former CTO of Microsoft</li>
<li>Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc.</li>
<li>Eliezer Yudkowsky, artificial intelligence researcher and writer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">Future Experiments</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago I ran into the <a href="http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/index.html">Programmer&#39;s Dvorak layout</a>
which made me want to eat my laptop. Just after I&#39;d gotten used to Dvorak I find
that there&#39;s an even more specific, supposedly more efficient, keyboard layout
designed for <em>my job</em>. Fffffuuuuuuuuuuu.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t promise I won&#39;t try it, but I&#39;ll probably wait for some sort of catalyst
before I do. By the way, if you&#39;re a coder, and you use that layout -- I look forward to
some first hand accounts of its usefulness.</p>
